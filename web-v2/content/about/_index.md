This website is both a **portfolio** and a **personal blog**. Recruiters can explore my work easily through the links provided on the sidebar while curious visitors can read my thoughts.

For my first version of this website, I coded all the CSS manually to really understand the basics and appreciate automation later; but I'm now using [one of my favorite Hugo themes](https://github.com/lukeorth/poison), since I'm eager to learn more about it and make templates for the community.

If you're looking for **my work**:

**If you're interested in knowing more about me,** I was born and raised in Spain, where I still live today. My days are spent studying network and system administration, coding, designing and working.

I'm passionate about learning and doing my best in meaningful ways. Whether it's experimenting with a new project, designing a web or preparing a meal, I strive to put care and effort in everything I do. I'm always looking for opportunities to challenge myself and keep growing, because I believe that **continuous persistence** and **improvement** are the right paths.

I'm curious by nature, so I'm open to many roles in IT: *whether it's supporting systems, building websites or solving cybersecurity challenges.* I enjoy learning what's needed and adapting my skills to get things done.

Personally, I'm a quiet person who likes to read, journal, write, draw, spend time in nature, attend IT events (*sometimes volunteering*) and tackle cybersecurity challenges on TryHackMe. I currently don't have much time to do any of these due to work, but I try.

I'm far from perfect, but I believe in always striving to improve: both in my skills and as a person. My long-term goal is simple: build a stable, fulfilling career that will one day support the life I dream of - a home of my own and a family to share it with.

If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email. I would love suggestions for new topics to write about. **Thanks for reading, see ya! ♡**
