      <p>
        This website is both a <strong>portfolio and a personal blog</strong>.
        Recruiters can explore my work easily through the links provided on the
        main page while curious visitors can read my blog, see my recommended
        links or even check my list of books.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my first version of this website, I coded all the CSS manually to
        really understand the basics and appreciate automation later; but I plan
        to rebuild it using Hugo, since I'm eager to learn more about it and
        make templates for the community.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're interested in knowing more about me, I was born and raised in
        Spain, where I still live today. My days are spent studying network and
        system administration, coding, designing and working. While I lean
        towards minimalism in my personal life (<em
          >as you can see in this website</em
        >), I enjoy traditional maximalist layouts as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about learning and doing my best in meaningful ways.
        Whether it's experimenting with a new project, designing a web or
        preparing a meal, I strive to put care and effort in everything I do.
        I'm always looking for opportunities to challenge myself and keep
        growing, because I believe that continuous persistence and improvement
        are the right paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm curious by nature, so I'm open to many roles in IT: whether it's
        supporting systems, building websites or solving cybersecurity
        challenges. I enjoy learning what's needed for each challenge and
        adapting my skills to get things done.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a quiet person who likes to read, journal, draw, attend IT events
        (sometimes volunteering) and tackle cybersecurity challenges on
        TryHackMe. I currently don't have much time to do any of these, but I
        try.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm far from perfect, but I believe in always striving to improve: both
        in my skills and as a person. My long-term goal is simple: build a
        stable, fulfilling career that will one day support the life I dream of
        - a home of my own and a family to share it with.
